Team Fortress 2 Idler

This is a simple script that makes it easier to idle with several accounts.

What this does:
    1. Kills Steam, if it is running.
    2. Starts Steam again, with the first account on the list.
    3. Starts Team Fortress 2 in text mode. (You can change the parameters 
by editing the code)
    4. Waits for 12 hours.
    5. Kills Team Fortress 2.
    6. Kills Steam.
    7. Repeats the whole process with the next account.
    8. ?????
    9. PROFIT

What this does not:

    1. Transfer items from one account to another.
    2. Scrap banking.
    3. Crafting weapons into scrap metal.


    WARNING: The script is provided 'as is' without any guarantees
whatsoever as to the actual coolness from Valve about you running this.
This does not interfere with any Team Fortress 2 files and doesn't do
anything you wouldn't be able to do with simple batch files, but if you
want to stay on the safe side, don't run it.
