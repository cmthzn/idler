Shows you a list of every account you added to the config file and lets\r\nyou choose one (or several) for sequencial idling.  \r\n1.1 You can also press the `+` key on your keyboard to add accounts to a\r\nqueue.\r\n2. Kills Steam, if it is running.\r\n3. Shows you a list of all your accounts, and an option to idle with all\r\naccounts.\r\n4. Starts Steam again, with the selected account.\r\n5. Starts Team Fortress 2 in text mode. (You can change the parameters by\r\nediting the code).\r\n6. Waits for the amount of hours that were set up at config.ini. A countdown\r\nwill be shown, along with information about recent drops. Most of the screen\r\noutput is also saved to a log file, default \"`idling.log`\".\r\n7. Kills Team Fortress 2.\r\n8. Kills Steam.\r\n9. Repeats the whole process with the next account.\r\n\r\n\r\n`> idler -login [accountname]`\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nKills Steam if it's running, and starts it with the account specified at\r\n[accountname].\r\n\r\n`> idler -start`\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nStarts idling with the currently logged in account.\r\n\r\n`> idler -continue`\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nStarts an idling session based on an already running TF2 session. The\r\nlogged-in account is detected automatically.\r\n\r\n`> inv [account | -all] [-full]`\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nShows the contents of the first page of 'account's inventory, or use `-all`\r\nto see the inventories of all accounts in your config file. You can also add\r\nthe `-full' argument to see the whole inventory instead of only the first\r\npage. Special drops like hats will have an asterisk preceding them. This\r\ncommand also accepts multiple account names, separated by space.\r\n\r\n`> inv -all`\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSame as before, but for all of your accounts.\r\n\r\n`> inv -watch [account]`\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n Watches for new drops at [account]'s inventory. This feature is actually\r\nbroken and is not currently implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\nWhat this does not:\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n1. Transfer items from one account to another.\r\n2. Scrap banking.\r\n3. Crafting weapons into scrap metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING: The script is provided 'as is' without any guarantees\r\nwhatsoever as to the actual coolness from Valve about you running this.\r\nanything you wouldn't be able to do with simple batch files, but if you\r\nThis does not interfere with any Team Fortress 2 files and doesn't do\r\nwant to stay on the safe side, don't run it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFiles:\r\n\r\n    \\idler.py          The actual script, plus some other functions.
